Greetings!!!
That is a pretty straight foward algorithm meant to be the first uploaded to GitHub and see how it works.
Then there is not much to read in this readme.
This simply parses some 24 bit bitmap and creates a gray scale copy.
The program receives two arguments: the origin bitmap file and the path to the gray copy.
Here red, green and blue are taken as equally significant to the color intensity.
